# Wolf-B-Gone
## Description
This project coded in Python alerts the user if a chicken predator is detected in some images. It is to keep a chicken farm safe from predators: an email is sent to user if a predator is detected in images.

## Requirements
Required libraries:
- tkinter
- smtplib
- email
- os
- kerras
- tensorflow
- cv2
- numpy
- argparse

## Installation
To download the project, type in shell to clone with hhtp : 

git clone https://gitlab-ovh-06.cloud.centralesupelec.fr/pierre.chardin/reconnaissance_image_gr4.git

To clone with ssh :

 git clone git@gitlab-ovh-06.cloud.centralesupelec.fr:pierre.chardin/reconnaissance_image_gr4.git

## Usage
To run the program, run the file main.py. A window opens, follow the instructions.

## Support
For any questions or suggestions, please send an email to coding_weeks_cs_wolf-b-gone@protomail.com.

## Ideas of development
Images could come from videos thanks to a movement dectector: pictures are taken when some movement is detected. The same thing could be made with a noise detector: an IA would distinguish animal noises and trigger an image capture.

When predators are deteceted, noise could be produced to drive them away.
